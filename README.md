A simple `.js` seamless sweater pattern generator based on Elizabeth Zimmermann's percentages, described [here](https://tutorials.knitpicks.com/percentage-system/). 

## to-do
- no clue how to do user input!
  - `promptInt()`?
  - the only three numbers the user has to provide are true bust circumference, horizontal stitch gaze, and desired ease
  - looking at `.js` forms but it also feels like a `.php` game lol
- choose your own adventure:
  - for inches/centimeters
  - for top-down or bottom-up
  - for circular yoke vs. raglan
- dream is to have the lightest HTML possible
