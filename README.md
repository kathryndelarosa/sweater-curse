A simple `.js` top-down, seamless sweater pattern generator based on [Elizabeth Zimmermann's percentages](https://tutorials.knitpicks.com/percentage-system/). Definitely imperfect, because knitting operates on integers and I'm not sure how to run this math without floats (yetâ€”might the answer be increments and not multiplication). I keep having 3 extra sts in the armpits so far.

## to-do
- no clue how to do user input!
  - `promptInt()`?
  - the only three numbers the user has to provide are true bust circumference, horizontal stitch gaze, and desired ease
  - looking at `.js` forms but it also feels like a `.php` game lol
- choose your own adventure:
  - inches/centimeters
  - ~~top-down or bottom-up~~ top down Only jesus
  - for circular yoke vs. raglan
