Knitting and code both scratch the math brain and can really only be learnt by doing, so in that spirit: a simple `.js`-powered generator based on [Elizabeth Zimmermann's sweater percentages](https://tutorials.knitpicks.com/percentage-system/). From *Knitting without Tears*, 1971:
>You may wish to change the percentages a bit to suit your taste, or the shape of the wearer. Feel free. I shall have failed in my endeavor if you copy my designs too slavishly; they are intended only as a guide, so be your own designer. No two people knit alike, look alike, think alike; why should their projects be alike? Your sweater should be like your own favorite original recipes—like nobody else’s on earth.
>And a good thing too.

This is also me challenging myself not to procrastinate with CSS.
