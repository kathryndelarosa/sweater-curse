Knitting and code both scratch the math brain and can really only be learnt by doing, so in that spirit: a simple `.js`-powered generator based on [Elizabeth Zimmermann's sweater percentages](https://tutorials.knitpicks.com/percentage-system/). From *Knitting without Tears*, 1971:
>You may wish to change the percentages a bit to suit your taste, or the shape of the wearer. Feel free. I shall have failed in my endeavor if you copy my designs too slavishly; they are intended only as a guide, so be your own designer. No two people knit alike, look alike, think alike; why should their projects be alike? Your sweater should be like your own favorite original recipes—like nobody else’s on earth.
>And a good thing too.

This is also me challenging myself not to procrastinate with CSS.

- really really think the math is right this time; the answer was # of raglan rounds are a more human variable than percentages
- still stressed out about user html input into a form
- if I am really publishing this I will be writing journalistic copy on Elizabeth, and will doodle a schematic.
- BOR starts exactly at the back R shoulder raglan.
- three big design choices for pattern improv imo:
    - are you starting with the collar, or picking up your cast on to add a collar later?
    - what stitch pattern are you doing? this determines the sort of increase you do and the frequency of your raglan rounds. if doing brioche or some kind of fisherman's rib, you should probably opt for 2-stitch increases, equalling 16 increases per reglan round you'd have to stagger more than plain stockinette.
    - do you want to do short rows? i don't think this involves extra math since it's much easier to do short rows with giant obvious raglan columns that tell you where you are
- I think the math is pretty good right now, so my next issue is making an HTML form that feeds into the console.log variables? constants?
