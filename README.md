A simple `.js`-powered seamless sweater pattern generator based on [Elizabeth Zimmermann's percentages](https://tutorials.knitpicks.com/percentage-system/).

## to-do
- no clue how to do user input!
  - `promptInt()`?
  - the only three numbers the user has to provide are true bust circumference, horizontal stitch gaze, and desired ease
  - looking at `.js` forms but it also feels like a `.php` game lol
- choose your own adventure:
  - inches/centimeters
  - top-down or bottom-up
  - for circular yoke vs. raglan
-  I'm putting in short rows idc!! they're skippable, we can make them skippable
