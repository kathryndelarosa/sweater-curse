A simple `.js` calculator based on Elizabeth Zimmermann's seamless sweater percentage system described in *Knitting Without Tears*. 

Running list of IDK's:
- no clue how to do user input!
  - `promptInt()`?
  - The only three numbers the user has to provide are true bust circumference, horizontal stitch gaze, and desired ease.
- how to fork in the road:
  - for inches/centimeters
  - for top-down or bottom-up
  - for circular yoke vs. raglan
- dream is to have the lightest HTML possible
